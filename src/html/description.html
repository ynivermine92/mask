          <h4 class="description__title">N95 Respirators</h4>
          <p class="description__text">
            The N95 mask is a form of respiratory protective wear worn over the
            nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of inhaling airborne
            particles like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable mask made
            from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised
            process called melt blowing. During this process, the inner layer of
            the N95 mask is created which forms the filtration layer capable of
            filtering out at <strong>least 95% </strong>of airborne particles
            when worn correctly.
          </p>
          <p class="description__text">
            During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of
            intense air pollution, wearing <strong>N95 masks</strong> has been
            shown to help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering
            out nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate
            existing respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered
            respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy and
            people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can
            particularly benefit from wearing face masks while they are out in
            public and unable to control the breathing environments that they
            find themselves in.

            N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
          </h4>
          <p class="description__text">
            Most N95 respirators are manufactured for use in construction and
            other industrial type jobs that expose workers to dust and small
            particles. They are regulated by the National Personal Protective
            Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute for
            Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part of the Centers
            for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
          </p>
          <p class="description__text">
            However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care
            setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective
            devices used and worn by health care personnel during procedures to
            protect both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer
            of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These
            surgical N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA,
            under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
